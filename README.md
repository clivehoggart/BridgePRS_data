Repository of scripts and resultant models generated for BridgePRS paper. Scripts are split into directories of
1) mass_gwas.nf - nextflow script to generate UKB GWAS summary statistics
2) sim_scripts - scripts used to generate and analyse simulated data 
3) ukb_scripts - scripts for the analysis of UKB cohort
4) eas_scripts - scripts to generate and test EAS models using UKB (Europeans) and BBJ to estimate models and UKB East Asians to validate models 
5) biome_scripts - scripts used to validate models estimated using UKB and BBJ data in the Biome cohort
6) models - SNP weights esatimated by BridgePRS (and used in paper) for AFR, SAS (19 traits) and EAS (9 traits) populations
